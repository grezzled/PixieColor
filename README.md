# PixieColor - C# language
### I developed this app in 2015 and been forgotten until I found it by chance along with some other small projects.

PixieColor is a simple windows application that allows designers to pick a color on their screens. To use it, is very simple just move your cursor over the desired color PixieColor will tell you the values of that color in a range of different formats (HEX,RGB..etc), then copy it by tap and hold Ctrl-Shift-C on your keyboard. 

Made with ❤️ using Visual Studio
