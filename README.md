# PixieColor - C# language
### I developed this app in 2015 and been forgotten until I found it by chance along with some other small projects.

**What is this!**
PixieColor is a simple windows application that allows designers to pick a color on their screens.
**How to use it?**
Just move your cursor over the desired color PixieColor will tell you the values of that color in a range of different formats (HEX,RGB..etc), then tap & hold ```Ctrl-Shift-C``` to copy. 

Made with ❤️ using Visual Studio
